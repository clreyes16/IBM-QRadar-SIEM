README
This how-to-guide provides instruction on how to properly configure a local updates repository for QRadar. Within air-gapped environments there is zero internet connection, making the ability to retrieve Autoupdates directly from IBM to QRadar impossible. In order to properly retrieve Autoupdates it is critical to follow the "QRadar Air-Gapped AutoUpdate Guide.pdf" within this directory. Autoupdates are critical to QRadar as they provide information to such as configuration updates, DSM updates, as well as major and minor updates (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=tasks-automatic-updates). This is sometimes a looked over part of QRadar administration and one which must be kept on top of.
